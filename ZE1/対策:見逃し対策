Process was also changed to install the hose and engage the first grenade clamp then proceed to the install of the other end of the hose and engage grenade clamp to prevent operators from having to go back to the bottom hose a second time. Clip counters installed on the job with line stop capability that requires the operator to discard the blue grenade clamps once the clamp has been engaged to the hose. If the grenade clamp is not properly discarded into the clip counter, the line will stop and require a bypass, alerting the operator and offline of an abnormal condition to prevent defect outflow."

Raised awareness to workgroup of warranty concern. New AC drain hose pucks were fabricated with a smaller diameter at the widest opening of the puck (15mm vs 17mm) for use on Leaf AC drain hoses only. These pucks are blue in color to differentiate between the white pucks used on other models and labeled Leaf only for reference. SOS work instructions were updated to callout the use of the new blue pucks on Leaf and visuals were also updated with the new pucks. Operators were trained on the reasoning behind the blue pucks and were instructed to no longer use the white pucks to ensure quality. All old style pucks were removed from both the scan in and scan out station and replaced with the new style. These two scan in and scan out stations only handle Leaf pucks. 
{NNA-PIR-22-00652}
Raised awareness to workgroup of warranty concern. Quality alert was issued to all zones responsible for the AC drain hose process to heighten awareness around the outflow and also level operators on the purpose behind the installation and removal of the pucks and how to detect/respond if a no good condition is found during the installation or removal of the pucks to prevent outflow. Jobs were rebalanced to eliminate scanning the puck and placing the puck in the floor board. The process is now set up for the AC drain hose to be connected in Z13, the puck scanned and immediately inserted to the hose in z15 for the first quality check, and then the puck be removed and scanned out as OK in z17 as the second (200%) quality check. The previous process was set up to remove the puck in Chassis versus Trim where the puck was installed so the reaction time to a no good condition could be delayed or potentially missed if identified. The connection, puck installation, and puck removal is now all performed in Trim to allow better visibility and feedback in the event of an issue to better protect quality. SOS work instructions in all affected zones were updated to reflect process improvements. Red rabbits were ran to verify effectiveness. All red rabbits performed were identified by the operators and proper help call procedures/repairs were followed.
